# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This project demonstrates and compares multiple **pathfinding algorithms** on a grid-based map.  
It supports both weighted and unweighted grids and provides detailed statistics for each algorithm.

## âœ¨ Features
- Implements **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Greedy Best-First, A*, and Bellman-Ford**.
- Handles **walls**, **weighted cells (1â€“9)**, and normal cells.
- Outputs:
  - Whether a path is found
  - Nodes explored
  - Execution time (in microseconds)
  - Path cost
- Saves marked grids (`output.txt`) showing explored nodes (`+`) and final path (`*`).

## ðŸ“‚ Input Format
